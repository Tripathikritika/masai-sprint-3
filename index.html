                The Lord of the Rings, fantasy novel by J.R.R. Tolkien initially published in 
                three parts as The Fellowship of the Ring The Two Towers and The Return of the King. The novel, set in the Third Age of Middle Earth, 
                formed a sequel to Tolkien’s The Hobbit and was succeeded by his posthumous The 
                Silmarillion . <br> <br>

                The Lord of the Rings is the saga of a group of sometimes reluctant heroes who set forth to save their world from consummate evil. 
                Its many worlds and creatures were drawn from Tolkien’s extensive knowledge of philology and folklore.
                An ancient Ring thought lost for centuries has been found, and through a strange twist of fate has been given to a small Hobbit named Frodo.
                At 33, the age of adulthood among hobbits, Frodo Baggins receives a magic Ring of Invisibility from his uncle Bilbo.
                Frodo, a Christlike figure, learns that the ring has the power to control the entire world and, he discovers, to corrupt its owner.
                When Gandalf discovers the Ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron, Frodo must make an epic quest to the Cracks of Doom in order to destroy it.
                However, he does not go alone.
                He is joined by Gandalf, Legolas the elf, Gimli the Dwarf, Aragorn, Boromir, and his three Hobbit friends Merry, Pippin, and Samwise. 
                Through mountains, snow, darkness, forests, rivers and plains, facing evil and danger at every corner the Fellowship of the Ring must go.They are opposed on their harrowing mission by the evil Sauron and his Black Riders .
                Their quest to destroy the One Ring is the only hope for the end of the Dark Lords reign. 
                The Lord of the Rings, together with The Hobbit, is considered by many to be the start of the genre known as high fantasy,and these works have had an enormous influence on that genre as a whole.
