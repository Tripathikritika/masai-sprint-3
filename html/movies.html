                In the Second Age of Middle-earth, the lords of Elves, Dwarves, and Men are given Rings of Power. 
                Unbeknownst to them, the Dark Lord Sauron forges the One Ring in Mount Doom, instilling into it a 
                great part of his power to dominate the other Rings so he might conquer Middle-earth. A final alliance
                of Men and Elves battles Sauron's forces in Mordor. The Ring's 
                influence corrupts Isildur, who takes it for himself. Isildur is later killed by Orcs, and the Ring is lost for 2,500 
                years, until it is found by Gollum, who owns it for five centuries. The Ring is then found by a hobbit named Bilbo 
                Baggins, who turns invisible when he puts it on but is unaware of its history. <br> <br>

                Sixty years later, Bilbo celebrates his 111th birthday in the Shire, reuniting with his old friend, the wizard Gandalf the Grey. 
                Bilbo reveals that he intends to leave the Shire for one last adventure, and he leaves his inheritance, including the Ring, to his
                nephew Frodo. Gandalf investigates the Ring, discovers its true nature, and learns that Gollum was captured and tortured by Sauron's
                Orcs, uttering two words during his interrogation: "Shire" and "Baggins." Gandalf returns and warns Frodo to leave the Shire. As Frodo 
                departs with his friend and gardener Samwise Gamgee, Gandalf rides to Isengard to meet with the wizard Saruman, but learns that he has 
                joined forces with Sauron, who has dispatched his nine undead Nazg没l servants to find Frodo. <br><br> </p>

                    Frodo and Sam are joined by fellow hobbits Merry and Pippin, and they evade the Nazg没l, arriving in Bree, where they are meant to meet
                    Gandalf. However, Gandalf never arrives, having been taken prisoner by Saruman. They are aided by a Ranger named Strider, who promises 
                    to escort them to Rivendell. The hobbits are ambushed by the Nazg没l on Weathertop, and their leader, the Witch-King, stabs Frodo with a
                    Morgul blade. Arwen, an elf and Strider's betrothed, rescues Frodo, summoning flood-waters that sweep the Nazg没l away. She takes him to 
                    Rivendell, where he is healed. Frodo meets Gandalf, who escaped Isengard with help from Gwaihir the Great Eagle.   <br> <br>    That night, Strider 
                    reunites with Arwen, and they confirm their love for each other.
                    Arwen's father, Lord Elrond, holds a council that decides the Ring must
                    be destroyed in Mount Doom. Frodo volunteers to take the Ring, accompanied by Gandalf, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Elf Legolas, Dwarf Gimli, 
                    Boromir of Gondor, and Strider, who is revealed to be Aragorn, Isildur's heir and the rightful King of Gondor. Bilbo, now living in 
                    Rivendell, gives Frodo his sword, Sting.
                    The Fellowship travels by river to Parth Galen. Frodo wanders off and is confronted by Boromir, who tries to take the Ring.
                    The Fellowship is then ambushed by the Uruk-hai. Merry and Pippin are taken captive, and Boromir is mortally wounded by the 
                    Uruk chieftain, Lurtz. Aragorn arrives, slays Lurtz, and watches Boromir die peacefully. Afraid of the Ring corrupting his friends, 
                    Frodo decides to travel to Mordor alone, but then reconsiders by allowing Sam to come after hearing his promise from Gandalf. Aragorn, 
                    Legolas, and Gimli decide to rescue Merry and Pippin.
