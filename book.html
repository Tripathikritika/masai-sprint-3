                The Lord of the Rings is an epic high-fantasy novel written by English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien. 
                The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work.
                Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written, with over 
                150 million copies sold.The title of the novel refers to the story's main antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron, who had in an 
                earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule 
                all of Middle-earth. From quiet beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land not unlike the English countryside, the story ranges across 
                Middle-earth, following the course of the War of the Ring through the eyes of its characters, most notably the hobbits Frodo, Sam,
                Merry and Pippin.Although generally known to readers as a trilogy, the work was initially intended by Tolkien to be one volume of 
                a two-volume set, the other to be The Silmarillion, but this idea was dismissed by his publisher. For economic reasons, 
                The Lord of the Rings was published in three volumes over the course of a year from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955.
                The three volumes were titled The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and The Return of the King. Structurally, 
                the novel is divided internally into six books, two per volume, with several appendices of background material included at the end. 
                Some editions combine the entire work into a single volume. The Lord of the Rings has since been reprinted numerous times and translated 
                into 38 languages.Tolkien's work has been the subject of extensive analysis of its themes and origins. 
                Although a major work in itself, the story was only the last movement of a larger epic Tolkien had worked on since 1917,
                in a process he described as mythopoeia. Influences on this earlier work, and on the story of The Lord of the Rings, 
                include philology, mythology, religion and the author's distaste for the effects of industrialization, as well as earlier 
                fantasy works and Tolkien's experiences in World War I. The Lord of the Rings in its turn is considered to have had a 
                great effect on modern fantasy; the impact of Tolkien's works is such that the use of the words "Tolkienian" and "Tolkienesque" has 
                been recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary.The enduring popularity of The Lord of the Rings has led to numerous references in 
                popular culture, the founding of many societies by fans of Tolkien's works, and the publication of many books about Tolkien 
                and his works. The Lord of the Rings has inspired, and continues to inspire, artwork, music, films and television, video games, 
                board games, and subsequent literature. Award-winning adaptations of The Lord of the Rings have been made for radio, theatre, and film.
                In 2003, it was named Britain's best novel of all time in the BBC's The Big Read. In 2015, the BBC ranked The Lord of the Rings 26th on 
                its list of the 100 greatest British novels.

                <h3> The Fellowship of the Ring </h3>
                <p class="para">
                    The narrative follows on from The Hobbit, in which the hobbit Bilbo Baggins finds the Ring, which had been in the possession of 
                    the creature Gollum. The story begins in the Shire, where Frodo Baggins inherits the Ring from Bilbo, his cousin and guardian. 
                    Neither hobbit is aware of the Ring's nature, but Gandalf the Grey, a wizard and an old friend of Bilbo, suspects it to be the 
                    Ring lost by Sauron, the Dark Lord, long ago. Seventeen years later, after Gandalf confirms this is true, he tells Frodo the history 
                    of the Ring and counsels him to take it away from the Shire. Frodo sets out, accompanied by his gardener, servant and friend, 
                     "Sam" Gamgee, and two cousins, Meriadoc "Merry" Brandybuck and Peregrin "Pippin" Took. They are nearly caught by the Nazgûl, 
                     but shake off their pursuers by cutting through the Old Forest. There they are aided by Tom Bombadil, a strange and merry fellow 
                     who lives with his wife Goldberry in the forest.

                    The hobbits reach the town of Bree, where they encounter a Ranger named Strider, whom Gandalf had mentioned in a letter.
                     Strider persuades the hobbits to take him on as their guide and protector. Together, they leave Bree after another close 
                     escape from the Nazgûl. On the hill of Weathertop, they are again attacked by the Nazgûl, who wound Frodo with a cursed blade. 
                     Strider fights them off and leads the hobbits towards the Elven refuge of Rivendell. Frodo falls deathly ill from the wound. 
                     The Nazgûl nearly capture him at the Ford of Bruinen, but flood waters summoned by Elrond, master of Rivendell, rise up and overwhelm them.
                    
                    Frodo recovers in Rivendell under Elrond's care. The Council of Elrond discusses the history of Sauron and the Ring. 
                    Strider is revealed to be Aragorn, Isildur's heir. Gandalf reports that the chief wizard Saruman has betrayed them and 
                    is now working to become a power in his own right. The Council decides that the Ring must be destroyed, but that can only be 
                    done by sending it to the fire of Mount Doom in Mordor, where it was forged. Frodo takes this task upon himself. Elrond, with 
                    the advice of Gandalf, chooses companions for him. The Company of the Ring. also called the Fellowship of the Ring, are nine in 
                    number: Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gandalf, Gimli the Dwarf, Legolas the Elf, and the Man Boromir, son of Denethor, 
                    the Ruling Steward of the land of Gondor.
                    
                    After a failed attempt to cross the Misty Mountains over the Redhorn Pass, the Company take the perilous path through the Mines of 
                    Moria. They learn of the fate of Balin and his colony of Dwarves. After surviving an attack, they are pursued by Orcs and by a Balrog, 
                    an ancient fire demon. Gandalf faces the Balrog, and both of them fall into the abyss. The others escape and find refuge in the Elven 
                    forest of Lothlórien, where they are counselled by its rulers, Galadriel and Celeborn.
                    
                    With boats and gifts from Galadriel, the Company travel down the River Anduin to the hill of Amon Hen. There, Boromir tries to take
                     the Ring from Frodo, but Frodo puts it on and disappears. Frodo chooses to go alone to Mordor, but Sam guesses what he intends and 
                     goes with him.</p>

                <h3>The Two Towers</h3>
                <p class="para">
                    Uruk-hai sent by Saruman and other Orcs sent by Sauron kill Boromir and capture Merry and Pippin. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas debate which 
                    pair of hobbits to follow. They decide to pursue the Orcs taking Merry and Pippin to Saruman. In the kingdom of Rohan, the Orcs are slain 
                    by a company of Rohirrim. Merry and Pippin escape into Fangorn Forest, where they are befriended by Treebeard, the oldest of the tree-like 
                    Ents. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas track the hobbits to Fangorn. There they unexpectedly meet Gandalf.

                    Gandalf explains that he slew the Balrog. Darkness took him, but he was sent back to Middle-earth to complete his mission. He is clothed 
                    in white and is now Gandalf the White, for he has taken Saruman's place as the chief of the wizards. Gandalf assures his friends that Merry 
                    nd Pippin are safe. Together they ride to Edoras, capital of Rohan. Gandalf frees Théoden, King of Rohan, from the influence of Saruman's 
                    spy Gríma Wormtongue. Théoden musters his fighting strength and rides with his men to the ancient fortress of Helm's Deep, while Gandalf 
                    departs to seek help from Treebeard.
                    
                    Meanwhile, the Ents, roused by Merry and Pippin from their peaceful ways, attack Isengard, Saruman's stronghold, and trap the wizard in 
                    the tower of Orthanc. Gandalf convinces Treebeard to send an army of Huorns to Théoden's aid. Gandalf brings an army of Rohirrim to Helm's 
                    Deep, and they defeat the Orcs, who flee into the forest of Huorns, never to be seen again. Gandalf offers Saruman a chance to turn away from 
                    vil. When Saruman refuses to listen, Gandalf strips him of his rank and most of his powers.
                    
                    After Saruman crawls back to his prison, Wormtongue drops a sphere to try to kill Gandalf. Pippin picks it up. It is revealed to be a palantír, 
                     seeing-stone that Saruman used to speak with Sauron and through which Saruman was ensnared. Pippin is seen by Sauron. Gandalf rides for Minas 
                     Tirith, chief city of Gondor, taking Pippin with him.
                    
                    Frodo and Sam capture Gollum, who has followed them from Moria. They force him to guide them to Mordor. They find that the Black Gate of Mordor 
                    is too well guarded, so instead they travel to a secret way Gollum knows. On the way, they encounter Faramir, who, unlike his brother Boromir, 
                    resists the temptation to seize the Ring. Gollum – who is torn between his loyalty to Frodo and his desire for the Ring – betrays Frodo by leading 
                    m to the great spider Shelob in the tunnels of Cirith Ungol. Frodo falls to Shelob's sting. But with the help of Galadriel's gifts, Sam fights off 
                    the spider. Believing Frodo to be dead, Sam takes the Ring to continue the quest alone. Orcs find Frodo; Sam overhears them and learns that Frodo is 
                    still alive.</p>

                <h3>The Return of the King</h3>
                <p class="para">
                    Sauron sends a great army against Gondor. Gandalf arrives at Minas Tirith to warn Denethor of the attack, while Théoden musters the Rohirrim 
                    to ride to Gondor's aid. Minas Tirith is besieged. Denethor is deceived by Sauron and falls into despair. He burns himself alive on a pyre, 
                    nearly taking his son Faramir with him. Aragorn, accompanied by Legolas, Gimli and the Rangers of the North, takes the Paths of the Dead to 
                    recruit the Dead Men of Dunharrow, who are bound by a curse which denies them rest until they fulfil their ancient forsworn oath to fight for 
                    the King of Gondor.

                    Following Aragorn, the Army of the Dead strikes terror into the Corsairs of Umbar invading southern Gondor. Aragorn defeats the Corsairs 
                    and uses their ships to transport the men of southern Gondor up the Anduin, reaching Minas Tirith just in time to turn the tide of battle. 
                    Théoden's niece Éowyn, who joined the army in disguise, slays the Lord of the Nazgûl with help from Merry. Together, Gondor and Rohan defeat
                    Sauron's army in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, though at great cost. Théoden is killed, and Éowyn and Merry are wounded.

                    Meanwhile, Sam rescues Frodo from the tower of Cirith Ungol. They set out across Mordor. Aragorn leads an army of men from Gondor and Rohan 
                    to march on the Black Gate to distract Sauron from his true danger. His army is vastly outnumbered by the great might of Sauron. Frodo and 
                    Sam reach the edge of the Cracks of Doom, but Frodo cannot resist the Ring any longer. He claims it for himself and puts it on his finger.

                    Gollum suddenly reappears. He struggles with Frodo and bites off Frodo's finger with the Ring still on it. Celebrating wildly, Gollum loses 
                    his footing and falls into the Fire, taking the Ring with him. When the Ring is destroyed, Sauron loses his power forever. All he created 
                    collapses, the Nazgûl perish, and his armies are thrown into such disarray that Aragorn's forces emerge victorious.

                    Aragorn is crowned King of Arnor and Gondor, and weds Arwen, daughter of Elrond. The four hobbits make their way back to the Shire, only to
                     find that it has been taken over by men directed by one "Sharkey" (whom they later discover to be Saruman). The hobbits raise a rebellion 
                     and liberate the Shire, though 19 hobbits are killed and 30 wounded. Frodo stops the hobbits from killing the wizard after Saruman attempts
                      to stab Frodo, but Gríma turns on Saruman and kills him in front of Bag End, Frodo's home. He is slain in turn by hobbit archers, and the 
                      War of the Ring comes to its true end on Frodo's very doorstep.

                    Merry and Pippin are celebrated as heroes. Sam marries Rosie Cotton and uses his gifts from Galadriel to help heal the Shire. But Frodo is 
                    still wounded in body and spirit, having borne the Ring for so long. A few years later, in the company of Bilbo and Gandalf, Frodo sails from 
                    the Grey Havens west over the Sea to the Undying Lands to find peace.

                    In the appendices, Sam gives his daughter Elanor the Red Book of Westmarch, which contains the story of Bilbo's adventures and the War of the 
                    Ring as witnessed by the hobbits. Sam is then said to have crossed west over the Sea himself, the last of the Ring-bearers.
